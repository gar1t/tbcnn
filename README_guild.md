## Notes

- requirements causing issues for env init (what's needed here?)
- requires Python 2
- github config can be env var based
- Guild isn't installing project via setup.py on init
- crawl --out needs a default val
- params in vectorizer/ast2vec/parameters.py want to be exposed as
  args in vectorize/commands.py
